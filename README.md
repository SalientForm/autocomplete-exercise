# Autocomplete Exercise

React exercise for BioBot.

I am an Angular developer currently, so this exercise is the first time I have touched React in over a year. Best 
practices specific to React are not fresh in my mind, so I am at a disadvantage if I am judged on this directly 
given length of time recommended for the exercise.

This I would add with additional time:

- Simple example of routing
- Real backend that connects to a database such as Postgres
- At least a skeleton of how I might approach state-management
- Perhaps a bit of additional styling
